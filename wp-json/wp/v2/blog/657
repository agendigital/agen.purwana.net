It\u00a0has to be written concisely and able to explain about the scope of responsibilities of an employee. Here are some things of the Dos and Don\u2019ts in creating job description:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2>Dos<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Use a factual and impersonal style when writing the job description<br \/>\n&#8211; Focusing it\u00a0based on what department\u2019s need<br \/>\n&#8211; Using a complete sentences<br \/>\n&#8211; Write an accurate, concise, and complete job description<br \/>\n&#8211; Create a sentence with simple structure, try to not use unnecessary words which not contribute much for the pertinent information<br \/>\n&#8211; Begin each duty or task with an action verb<br \/>\n&#8211; Be consistent when using terms like \u201cmay\u201d and \u201coccasionally.\u201d (These should be used to describe tasks that are performed once in a while, or tasks that only some employees perform.)<br \/>\n&#8211; Try to give flexibility for the employee regarding to the jobdesc.<br \/>\n&#8211; Refer to job titles rather than incumbents, i.e., \u201cReports to _______ Manager\u201d instead of \u201cReports to Mary Smith.\u201d<br \/>\n&#8211; Be precise. This is critical for accurate job evaluation and analysis.<br \/>\n&#8211; Focus on critical activities.<br \/>\n&#8211; Use a logical sequence in describing duties and responsibilities (Key Responsibility first, followed by the corresponding duties).<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2>Don&#8217;ts<\/h2>\n<p>&#8211; Use the narrative form when writing\u00a0it<br \/>\n&#8211; Base the content of the job description on the capabilities, skills, and interests of the incumbent<br \/>\n&#8211; Write the job description based upon the desired job classification<br \/>\n&#8211; Write the job description as step by step guide on how to do the job<br \/>\n&#8211; Include minor or occasional tasks, which are not unique to a specific job.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want to know more about Human Resources important aspects?
